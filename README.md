# odin-recipes
The Odin Project - Project 1 - HTML Recipe 

First i created a github repository. Then i found the repository file i had created to host my github repos. I had setup the SSH key and all that earlier. 

I started by creating the index.html. i then added the recipes, following the criteria set forth in the project description. 

Then i added all the files to github using the 'git add "filename". 
i used 'git status' to check the status. 

Finally i edit this readme.md, i will add that aswell, and then push the project.
